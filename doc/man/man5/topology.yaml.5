.SH "NAME"
topology.yaml \-  Slurm configuration file for the topology plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.LP
\fBtopology.yaml\fR is a YAML-formatted configuration file that defines multiple
network topologies for optimizing job resource allocation in Slurm.
Each topology must have a unique \fBname\fR,
which can be associated with a partition via the \fBTopology=<name>\fR
parameter in the partitionâ€™s configuration.

Slurm supports three topology types: \fBblock\fR, \fBflat\fR, and \fBtree\fR.
The first topology defined in the file with the \fBcluster_default: true\fR
parameter will be used for partitions without an explicitly specified topology
and cluster-wide operations not tied to a partition
(e.g., slurmctld-to-slurmd communication).

The file must be located in the same directory as \fBslurm.conf\fR.

\fBNOTE\fR: Slurm will first check for topology.yaml.
If this file exists, topology.conf file will be ignored.
