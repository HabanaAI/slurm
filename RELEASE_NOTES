RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 24.08

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 24.08 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 23.02 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 23.02 or 23.11 to version 24.08 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

All SPANK plugins must be recompiled when upgrading from any Slurm version
prior to 24.08.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Remove support for Cray XC ("cray_aries") systems.
 -- Federation - allow client command operation when slurmdbd is unavailable.
 -- burst_buffer/lua - Added two new hooks: slurm_bb_test_data_in and
    slurm_bb_test_data_out. The syntax and use of the new hooks are documented
    in etc/burst_buffer.lua.example. These are required to exist. slurmctld now
    checks on startup if the burst_buffer.lua script loads and contains all
    required hooks; slurmctld will exit with a fatal error if this is not
    successful. Added PollInterval to burst_buffer.conf. Removed the arbitrary
    limit of 512 copies of the script running simultaneously.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- CoreSpecPlugin has been removed.
 -- Removed TopologyPlugin tree and dragonfly support from select/linear.
    If those topology plugins are desired please switch to select/cons_tres.
 -- Changed the default value for UnkillableStepTimeout to 60 seconds or five
    times the value of MessageTimeout, whichever is greater.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- Add support for "elevenses" as an additional time specification.
 -- Add support for sbcast --preserve when job_container/tmpfs configured
    (previously documented as unsupported).

API CHANGES
===========
 -- Removed ListIterator type from <slurm/slurm.h>.

SLURMRESTD CHANGES
==================
 -- openapi/dbv0.0.38 and openapi/v0.0.38 plugins have been removed.
 -- openapi/dbv0.0.39 and openapi/v0.0.39 plugins have been tagged as
    deprecated to warn of their removal in the next release.
 -- Changed slurmrestd.service to only listen on TCP socket by default.
    Environments with existing drop-in units for the service may need
    further adjustments to work after upgrading.
